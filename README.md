### Problem Statement

Rodents have always been a big health issue in NYC especially for the restaurant industry. Restaurant consulting services are provided to restaurants owners for helping them solve issues in various aspects of their business. Location is one of most important factors for new restaurants. 

In this project, we are going to focus on Manhattan area with two datasets [Rodent Inspection in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj) and [Restaurant-Inspection](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j ) from New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). We are going to look at the restaurants in neighborhoods with high rates of rat activity, which do not have rat related inspection violations.  


**Datasets:**

### Limitation   
- Thousands of restaurants start business and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status are included in the dataset.  
- Note that if a property/taxlot does not appear in the file, that does not indicate an absence of rats - rather just that it has not been inspected.   
- Neighborhoods with higher rates of active rat signs may not actually have higher rat populations but simply have more inspections.
