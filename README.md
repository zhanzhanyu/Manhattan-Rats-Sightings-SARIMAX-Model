### Problem Statement

Rodent has always been a big health issue in NYC especially for restaurant industry. Restaurant consulting services are provised to restaurants owners for helping them solve issues in various aspects of their business. Location chosing is one of most import factors for new restaunts. 

In this project, we are going to focus on Manhattan area in two datasets [Rodent Inspection in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj) and [Restaurant-Inspection](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j ) from New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). We are going to see if neighborhoods with higher rates of active have a higher restaurants inspection violation. With predicting the future rodent map, we are going to evaluate if this location is good for opening a new reataurant.(e.g. absence of rats in the past 1 year, 2 years or 3 years)   
(_Use time series focusing on one area_)

### Limitation   
- Thousands of restaurants start business and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status are included in the dataset.  
- Note that if a property/taxlot does not appear in the file, that does not indicate an absence of rats - rather just that it has not been inspected.   
- Neighborhoods with higher rates of active rat signs may not actually have higher rat populations but simply have more inspections.
