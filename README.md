### Problem Statement

It is the Year of Rat. Let's have a look at the Number 1 resident in New York City -- Rodent. Rodent has always been a big health issue in NYC. In this project, we are focus at two datasets [Rodent Inspection in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj) and [Restaurant-Inspection](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j ). We are going to find relationships between rats and neighborhood restaurants. With predicting the future rodent map, how would this affect neighborhood restaurants. (_One Idea: Use time series focusing on one area_)
